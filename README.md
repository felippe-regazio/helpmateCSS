Writing Style Sheets on SoC - A Proposal
Separation of concerns (SoC) applied to style sheets writing process.

-- SoC Layers:

1. Define the layout and position (prefer use grid)
2. Add basic properties (use atomic style - helpmate )
3. Add theme (atomize or note, do as you want)
4. Add self properties (element exclusive props)
5. Misc (animations, Thirty Party Needings, etc)
